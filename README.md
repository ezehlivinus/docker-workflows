## Technical Implementation

### Containerized Job with Service Integration
```yaml
name: Deployment (Container)
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - dev
env:
  CACHE_KEY: node-deps
  MONGODB_DB_NAME: gha-demo

jobs:
  test:
    environment: testing
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: node:16  # Custom container environment
    env:
      MONGODB_CONNECTION_PROTOCOL: mongodb
      MONGODB_CLUSTER_ADDRESS: mongodb  # Service container name
      MONGODB_USERNAME: root
      MONGODB_PASSWORD: example
      PORT: 8080
    services:
      mongodb:  # Service container definition
        image: mongo
        env:
          MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: root
          MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
    steps:
      - name: Get Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Cache dependencies
        uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: ~/.npm
          key: ${{ env.CACHE_KEY }}-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run server
        run: npm start & npx wait-on http://127.0.0.1:$PORT
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Output information
        run: echo "Tests completed in containerized environment"
```

### Container Network Communication Pattern
```yaml
# Application connects to MongoDB service container
env:
  MONGODB_CONNECTION_PROTOCOL: mongodb
  MONGODB_CLUSTER_ADDRESS: mongodb  # Container service name
  MONGODB_USERNAME: root
  MONGODB_PASSWORD: example

# Service container configuration
services:
  mongodb:
    image: mongo
    env:
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: root
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
```
